PokeModels is an open access education outreach initiative created by Jake Warner, Aurelien Doucet and Karine Nedoncelle.  

## How to Print:  
We provide two printing sizes, A4 and A3. Each file contains the front and back of the cards. 
The cards can be inexpensively printed by your local or university print shop and look best on high gloss card stock.

## Ideas for use:

### 2016 fÃªte de la science  
We used these cards with much success for the 2016 fete de la science. We 'hid' the cards at different tents that were also hosting activities. 
The students would receive a flyer, then have to find the cards by visiting the tents that hosted a activity relating to that organism. 
For example we hid the zebrafish card with at a tent which was demonstrating zebrafish development. 
When the students found all ten cards they were awarded a prize (in our case a 3D printed model organism).  

### Use in the classroom  
These cards could be used for 'rewards' for correct answers to students over the course of a term.
When the students collect all ten they receive a prize!
