	We used these cards with much success for the 2016 fete de la science. We 'hid' the cards at different tents that were also hosting activities. 
	The students would receive a flyer, then have to find the cards by visiting the tents that hosted a activity relating to that organisms. 
	For example we 'hid' the zebrafish card with at a tent which was demonstrating zebrafish development.
	When the students found all ten cards hey were awarded a prize (in our case a 3D printed model organism). </font></p>

	These cards could be used for 'rewards' for correct answers to students over the course of a term.
	When the students collect all ten they receive a prize!</font></p>

	We are currently working with partners to produce an accompanying app/game for the cards!</font></p>
